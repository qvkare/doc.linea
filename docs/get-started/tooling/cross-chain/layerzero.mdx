LayerZero is an omnichain interoperability protocol that enables cross-chain 
messaging. Applications built on Linea can use the LayerZero protocol to 
seamlessly connect to 35+ supported blockchains.

LayerZero Endpoint has been deployed on Linea for builders to leverage omnichain 
messaging in their dapps. LayerZero's Endpoint ULNv2 validation library relies 
on two parties, the Oracle and Relayer, to transfer messages between onchain 
smart contracts known as endpoints. When LayerZero sends a message from Linea to 
chain `X`, the message is routed through the endpoint on Linea to the ULNv2 
validation library. The ULNv2 library notifies the Oracle and Relayer of the 
message and its destination chain `X`. The Oracle forwards the packet hash to 
the endpoint on chain `X`, and the Relayer submits the packet to be verified 
onchain against the hash, and delivers the message.

As a developer, you can leverage LayerZero's Endpoint contract by using our 
`LzApp` interface for your User Application (UA). The Endpoint allows UAs to 
configure the Messaging Library for sending and receiving verified messages and 
guarantees the message-delivering ordering across all messaging libraries:

- `Send()`: the message will be sent through the endpoint first, and then 
redirected to the UA-configured Messaging Library. 
- `Receive()`: the message will be verified at the Messaging Library first, then 
forwarded to the endpoint and eventually delivered to the UA.
