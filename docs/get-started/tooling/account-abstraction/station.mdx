GroupOS by [Station](https://station.express) is a web3 toolkit designed to create and coordinate 
values-aligned networks in new ways. Accounts, the core module of GroupOS, enables organizations to 
create programmatic NFT wallets, incentivize users, and measure growth.

GroupOS is powered by [ERC-6551](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6551) and [ERC-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337).

## Use cases

Accounts enables organizations to use NFTs to capture members' identities more accurately, unlocking 
brand-new ways to engage and monetize.

- **Membership loyalty and rewards:** Create gamification and rewards systems where users can earn 
and exchange points and collectibles. Reward loyal and early users with exclusive access to 
product features or experiences.
- **Interoperable profile (”Passport”):** Create a portable identity system that grants users 
control over their digital identity and reputation, supporting user autonomy and reducing platform 
integration overhead and reliance on third-party entities.
- **Gasless onboarding:** Enable gasless and user-friendly onboarding through NFT-bound accounts (ERC-6551) 
and account abstraction (ERC-4337) standards. Provide new members with access to your NFT experience
without having to pay gas fees.
