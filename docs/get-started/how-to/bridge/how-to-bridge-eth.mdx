:::note

We recommend that only tech operators that are providing liquidity use Linea's native bridge to 
transfer ETH.

For everyday bridge transfers, we recommend you use the
[MetaMask Portfolio bridge](https://portfolio.metamask.io/bridge), which aggregates bridging options
across Linea and shows you the best rates. Alternatively, use one of the
[third-party bridges](https://bridge.linea.build/) available to users.
:::

The native Linea bridge allows you to claim your bridged funds manually, or automatically:

- **Manual claiming** Requires two transactions to be approved. One on the source layer to initiate the
bridging process and the other on the target layer by the recipient to receive the funds, which we call
"claiming". This means, to receive the funds, the recipient has to pay a fee on the target layer.

- **Automatic claiming** Requires one transaction to be approved on the source layer. The recipient will
automatically receive their funds because a "postman" will handle the claiming process for them.

## Transfer ETH using Linea's native bridge

This is a step-by-step guide to bridging ETH between Ethereum Mainnet (L1) to Linea (L2).

If you would like to bridge between Linea and other networks, we recommend you use one of the
third-party bridges available via [MetaMask Portfolio](https://portfolio.metamask.io/bridge).

## Bridge ETH from Ethereum (L1) to Linea (L2)

:::caution

Please use the automatic claiming option the first time you bridge ETH from L1 to L2. Manual 
claiming requires you to have L2 ETH available to pay for the fees.

If you don't have enough L2 ETH to cover the fees, your bridged funds will be stuck on the bridge 
until you can cover the fees.

:::

### Automatic claiming

1. Go to the bridge [here](https://bridge.linea.build/).

2. Connect your wallet in the top-right corner of the page.

    />
  </div>
</div>

3. Verify that the bridge is set to Ethereum → Linea Mainnet and that automatic claiming is enabled.

      alt="Linea bridge choose networks"
    />
  </div>
</div>

4. Enter the amount of ETH you want to bridge over to Linea Mainnet, and click the “Bridge” button.

      alt="Linea bridge choose amount"
    />
  </div>
</div>

5. MetaMask will pop up asking you to confirm the transaction.

      alt="Confirm Linea bridge transaction in MetaMask"
    />
  </div>
</div>

6. After confirming the transaction, it should take around 20 minutes for the transaction to reach 
Linea Mainnet. You can see your pending transaction under the "Transactions" tab.

<div class="center-container">
  <div class="img-large">

      alt="Linea bridge pending transaction"
    />
  </div>
</div>

7. When your transaction is complete, it should say "Complete" and your ETH should be on 
Linea Mainnet.

      alt="Linea bridge complete transaction"
    />
  </div>
</div>

8. You can see your Linea account balance in MetaMask once you switch to the Linea network. You can 
also check it on [Lineascan](https://lineascan.build/address/0x331FB12C080F5b34F0E8812D44114D17398A016d). 
Just replace the account address in the URL with your account address and it should reflect your 
account's balance.

## Bridge ETH from Linea Mainnet (L2) to Ethereum Mainnet (L1)

:::note

Automatic claiming is only available for bridging ETH from L1 to L2. You will not be able to select 
this option for L2 to L1 bridging.

:::

1. Go to the bridge [here](https://bridge.linea.build/).
